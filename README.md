# URP-PixelGrids
## Procedural shadergraph for simulating pixel grids on LCD/LED/CRT display panels or screens

### This project contains and demonstrates a shadergraph which is used to simulate close-up views of pixel grid geometry on LCD/LED/CRT panels. It uses the rounded rectabgle node, and some offsets, and supports distortion to some extent. It also supports offsetting the grid for a scanline-like effect. It is meant to be used as a renderer feature in the Universal Render Pipeline Possible applications for this graph are animated Scanline Overlays, or CRT-screen like distortion effects.
